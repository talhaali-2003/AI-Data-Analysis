Another important thing your Action step should always be: (Action: python_repl_ast) never include any backslashes or forward slashes at all:\n        Action: python_repl_ast\n        This is an EXAMPLE of what your Action Input step should be structured like, do not just use this every time, it\'s just what it should be structured like:\n        Action Input:\n        # Data analysis code\n        df_sorted[\'cpu_time_diff\'] = df_sorted[\'cpu_time\'].diff()\n        df_sorted_cleaned = df_sorted.dropna()\n        trend_summary = df_sorted_cleaned[\'cpu_time_diff\'].describe()\n        trend_summary\n\n        DONT FORGET, if you have code in your final answer ONLY DISPLAY THE CODE NO COMMENTS! This is an example of what your output should look like:\n        ```python\n        "example code"\n        ```\n\n        It should look like that so a helper function can clean your final answer and run the code!\n        Also Remember your final answer should always be CODE NEVER LEAVE COMMENTS IN THE CODE!\n        ', 'output': '```python\n570950\n```'}
