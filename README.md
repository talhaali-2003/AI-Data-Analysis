Welcome to my AI Data Analysis Application! 
This repository contains a Streamlit-based application that enables AI-driven data analysis and visualization through natural language queries. The app uses language models (LLMs) to classify user intent, generate Python code for analysis or plotting, and execute the code within the app to produce results.

Features:
Interactive Data Analysis: Enter natural language queries to analyze data, with AI generating the required Python code.
Visualization: Create plots like line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms based on your queries.
CSV Upload: Upload your own CSV files for analysis and visualization.
Real-time Feedback: Provide feedback on AI-generated results to improve future responses.
How It Works:
Data Input: Pull data from a test server or upload a CSV file.
Query Processing: The app classifies your query and generates Python code for analysis or plotting.
Output: The generated code is executed, and the results or visualizations are displayed.

Here a live demo of the application:
